## Problem Description
Why are skill trees better regarded than free skills? — Many games decide to use skill trees as their main character progression system. They provide an ordered yet limited step by step progression which can help novice players to get the ropes of the game.

Yet, I am trying to break those limitations by just offering a free skill whenever you level up. This provides a lot of control over your character, allow to have your build ready as soon as possible, and, with a proper reset feature, allow to experiment.

Yet, I get consistently worse results in engagement with a free skill system than skill trees. And I don't understand why. Maybe it's because players are biased to an already stablished system, maybe it's because it fails to create long term goals, maybe my audience is of one kind, but certainly, people seem to prefer skill trees.

Did anyone find this problem before? Anyone has a tested hypothesis of why this is happening?

## Best Human-rated Answer
I think it’s as simple as analysis paralysis. If I have to choose between 3 choices, I will read all 3 and make an informed decision. If I have to choose between 40, I will physically groan and skim over the first 5 and choose one.

This is not to say that a free system won’t work, just that it may need some additional visualizations to help people compartmentalization all the information. An idea, keep the choices free but group them by “aggressive, defensive, etc” then, additionally subgroup them by “low resource cost / high resource cost”.

Another feature of non-free skill trees is that seeing later abilities sets a goal for the player and incentivizes them to spend points in a certain way. This can also make them adapt to a playstyle in order to accomplish their goal.

## LLM Responses

### ChatGPT-5 Response
That’s a great design question — and a common frustration among devs trying to innovate on RPG-style progression. The issue you describe — *players preferring skill trees over free-skill systems* — has been studied and discussed quite a bit in game design circles, and there are several **psychological, structural, and feedback-related reasons** for why this happens.

Below are possible explanations *and* practical ways to address them:

---

### 🧠 1. **Players Need Guidance, Not Just Freedom**

**Why it happens:**
When you give players full freedom (“pick any skill at any time”), they often feel *overwhelmed* or *unguided*. Most players — especially casual ones — like to feel that they’re *making good choices* and *progressing correctly*. A skill tree naturally provides *implicit guidance* on “what comes next” and “what’s worth unlocking.”

**Possible solutions:**

* Add **recommended paths** or “starter builds” that visually show a few curated progressions.
* Use **soft prerequisites** (e.g., needing a certain stat level or prior experience) to create a sense of growth without hard-locking branches.
* Give **early game goals** or “milestones” (“Unlock Fireball → Greater Fireball → Inferno”) to mimic the feeling of a tree.

---

### 🎯 2. **Skill Trees Visualize Progress and Long-Term Goals**

**Why it happens:**
Skill trees *show* a journey — they make the player think, “If I keep playing, I’ll get *that* awesome ability.” The structure itself becomes motivational. Free skill systems, even with the same abilities, lack this *visible roadmap*.

**Possible solutions:**

* Provide a **visual planner** or “skill constellation” that shows all possible skills, with unlocked ones highlighted.
* Add **tiers** or “skill mastery levels” to give visible depth (like a map instead of a menu).
* Create **preview pop-ups** or “future unlocks” hints that tease next possible power spikes.

---

### 🧩 3. **Choice Without Context Feels Arbitrary**

**Why it happens:**
In a free-skill system, the player might not *understand* what’s optimal yet. Without constraints, every choice feels equally available — but also equally meaningless. The cognitive load of evaluating all skills can feel like homework rather than fun discovery.

**Possible solutions:**

* Gating or recommending skills by **playstyle** (“You seem to use ranged attacks — here are good ranged upgrades”).
* Add **thematic clusters** (“Pyromancy”, “Archery”, “Defense”) even without strict dependencies.
* Give **temporary trials** — let players try a skill once before committing.

---

### 🔁 4. **Skill Trees Imply Storytelling and Thematic Growth**

**Why it happens:**
Skill trees often double as *narrative devices* — showing how a character “learns” or “specializes.” A free system can feel abstract, as though skills are just numbers. Players like to feel their hero is *evolving in a particular direction*.

**Possible solutions:**

* Use **visual metaphors** (e.g., a book of spells filling up, a neural network growing, a dojo board of techniques).
* Add **flavor text or lore** around skills (“Having mastered Quick Shot, you now learn Piercing Arrow”).
* Tie **quests or achievements** to learning specific skill clusters.

---

### 🪞 5. **Perceived Fairness and Comparison**

**Why it happens:**
Skill trees give structure to compare progress (“I’m halfway down the Frost branch”), whereas free systems make it harder to gauge power level or achievement relative to others. Without visible progression milestones, advancement can feel flat.

**Possible solutions:**

* Add **titles or class specializations** based on chosen skills (“Fire Adept,” “Shieldmaster”).
* Track **build stats** or “path identities” that players can share or compare.
* Make **respecs earned**, not free, to give commitment more weight.

---

### 💡 6. **Skill Trees Create Anticipation and Momentum**

**Why it happens:**
In a tree, unlocking one node naturally leads to anticipation of the next. A free system lacks that “chain reaction” of small, satisfying goals.

**Possible solutions:**

* Add **combo unlocks** (“Having learned Fireball and Ignite, you now qualify for Flame Wave”).
* Reward **synergies** — certain skill combinations unlocking bonuses or visual upgrades.
* Provide **skill evolution paths** over time, so free picks still form a perceived chain.

---

### 🔬 Summary: What Might Be Happening in Your Case

If engagement drops with your free skill system, players might be:

* Feeling **overwhelmed** by too many open choices.
* Missing **clear visual or emotional goals**.
* Lacking **a sense of structured progress** or *“what’s next.”*
* Finding **respec freedom removes tension**, making choices feel less meaningful.

### 🧩 Hybrid Ideas (Compromises That Often Work)

If you want to keep your free-skill vision but capture what people love about trees:

1. **Skill Webs or Constellations** — open structure, but visually connected.
2. **Guided Free Choice** — every few levels, unlock a new “tier” of skills but still pick freely within it.
3. **Dynamic Recommendations** — suggest 2–3 “next logical skills” each level.
4. **Progressive Unlock System** — skills cost escalating points, encouraging planning without strict paths.

---

Would you like me to sketch a few **hybrid system design examples** (e.g., visual skill web, card-style free-choice interface, or tiered free progression mockup)? That might help you visualize how to keep freedom but retain the sense of progression players love.

### Gemini Response
This is a classic and fascinating problem in game design, often summarized by the psychological concept of **"The Paradox of Choice."**

Your observations are correct, and your hypotheses are likely all contributing to the issue. The short answer is: **Players *say* they want total freedom, but they often *enjoy* a system that provides guided, meaningful choices.**

Your "free skill" system (which sounds like a "skill store" or "skill list") fails to provide the psychological scaffolding that makes progression feel rewarding.

Here’s a breakdown of *why* skill trees consistently perform better for engagement, followed by solutions that blend your desire for freedom with the structure players crave.

### Why Skill Trees Are So "Sticky"

You're right that skill trees are "ordered yet limited," but those limitations are their greatest strength.

1.  **They Prevent Analysis Paralysis:** This is the #1 problem with your system. When a player levels up and is presented with a giant list of 50 skills, they have no context. They are forced to make a high-stakes decision (what if I pick a "bad" skill?) with low information. This creates anxiety, not excitement. A skill tree presents them with 2-3 immediate, understandable choices, making the decision feel manageable and meaningful.
2.  **They Create Long-Term Goals (Anticipation):** Your hypothesis is spot on. A player looks at a skill tree and sees an exciting "capstone" skill deep in a branch (e.g., "Dragon's Breath" or "Shadowstep"). They *can't* have it now, but they can see the *exact path* to get it. This creates a powerful, tangible, long-term goal that keeps them motivated for the next 10, 20, or 30 levels. A flat list has no "end goal" to build towards; all skills feel equally immediate.
3.  **They Teach the Game and Guide Builds:** Skill trees are a hidden tutorial. By placing "Increase Fire Damage" on the path to "Fireball," which is on the path to "Meteor," the tree *visually teaches* the player how to build a Fire Mage. It shows them which skills synergize. Your "free" list forces the player to read 50 tooltips and theorycraft these synergies themselves—work most players don't want to do.
4.  **They Make Pacing and the "Power Curve" Feel Good:** Your goal to "have your build ready as soon as possible" might be the very thing short-circuiting your engagement. The *journey* of building a character is often more fun than *having* the finished build. Skill trees pace this journey. You get small, consistent power-ups (the 5% damage nodes) that lead to big, exciting "milestone" skills. This creates a satisfying rhythm of investment and reward. A "build ready" system can make all subsequent levels feel meaningless.
5.  **They Make Choices Feel Weighty and Permanent (in a good way):** Because you must go down one branch *at the exclusion* of another (at least temporarily), the choice feels like it matters. It defines the character. "I am the 'Ice' specialist, not the 'Fire' specialist." A system with an easy reset can accidentally make choices feel meaningless. If you can respec at any time, then no single choice has any real weight.

### How to Fix Your System: The "Best of Both Worlds"

You don't have to scrap your system. You can introduce "structured freedom." The goal is to *guide* the player, not *constrain* them.

#### Solution 1: "Gated" or "Tiered" Unlocks
This is the simplest fix. Don't show the player all 100 skills at Level 1.
* **Levels 1-10:** Only "Tier 1" (Basic) skills are available to choose from.
* **Level 10:** The player unlocks the "Tier 2" (Advanced) skill list. This is an exciting event!
* **Level 25:** The player unlocks the "Tier 3" (Master) list.

This breaks the "analysis paralysis" by limiting the immediate choices and creates anticipation for unlocking the next tier.

#### Solution 2: The "Constellation" or "Mini-Tree" System (The *Skyrim* Model)
This is probably your best bet. Instead of one giant, interconnected tree, you present 5-10 small, thematic "clusters."
* You might have a "Pyromancy" cluster, a "One-Handed" cluster, a "Stealth" cluster, etc.
* Each cluster is its own mini-tree of 5-8 skills.
* When a player levels up, they can put their point *anywhere*. They could put one point in "Pyromancy" and their next point in "Stealth."

This achieves **all** of your goals:
* **Freedom:** The player can mix and match from any cluster.
* **Guidance:** Within each cluster, a novice player has a clear path ("This skill leads to this one").
* **Long-Term Goals:** They can see the "capstone" skill at the end of each mini-tree and work towards it.
* **No Paralysis:** The UI is clean and organized by theme, not just one giant list.

#### Solution 3: Prerequisite Chains (A "Soft" Tree)
Keep your "free list," but add prerequisites to the more powerful skills.
* **"Meteor" (Tier 3 skill):** Requires "Fireball" AND 5 points spent in the [Fire] category.
* **"Fireball" (Tier 2 skill):** Requires "Ignite" AND 2 points spent in the [Fire] category.
* **"Ignite" (Tier 1 skill):** No requirements.

This creates the *path* and *long-term goals* of a skill tree without the rigid visual branches. It still allows a player to dabble in multiple paths, but they must *commit* to a path to unlock its best skills.

#### Solution 4: Massive UI/UX Improvements
If you are determined to keep your "flat list," you must do the "teaching" work that a tree does:
* **Strong Tagging & Filtering:** Tag every skill (e.g., [Fire], [AoE], [Single Target], [Utility], [Passive]). Let players filter the list.
* **"Suggested Build" Callouts:** In the skill menu, have a small "Recommended for 'Pyromancers'" section that highlights 3-4 skills. This gives lost players a starting point.
* **Explicit Synergy Tooltips:** In the tooltip for "Fireball," add a line: "**Synergizes with:** *Fire Mastery, Ignite, Searing Touch*." You must explicitly show the player what works together.

### Summary

The problem isn't "freedom." The problem is **overwhelm** and a **lack of guided anticipation.**

Players don't want to be *stuck*, but they desperately want to be *guided*. Your "free" system makes them feel stupid and anxious, while a skill tree makes them feel smart and powerful as they "discover" the build path you laid out for them.

I strongly recommend exploring **Solution 2 (The "Constellation" / *Skyrim* Model)**, as it directly solves the "analysis paralysis" and "lack of long-term goals" while retaining the freedom you want to give your players.

### DeepSeek Response
Of course. This is a classic and insightful design problem. You've correctly identified some of the key trade-offs, but the reasons for the engagement drop are likely more fundamental to human psychology and game design principles.

First, let's validate your hypotheses and then expand on them with tested reasons and solutions.

### Your Hypotheses (Which are Partly Correct)

*   **Player Bias:** Yes, players are familiar with skill trees. Familiarity lowers the cognitive barrier to entry. A "free skill" system might initially be perceived as overwhelming or lacking structure.
*   **Long-Term Goals:** This is a **major** factor. Skill trees visually map out a journey. Unlocking "Fireball II" is a goal; seeing it connected to "Fireball I" makes the path clear. A free system can feel like a series of disconnected events without a compelling long-term arc.
*   **Audience Type:** Also true. Players who gravitate towards deep RPGs or complex games often *enjoy* the planning and optimization that a tree facilitates.

### The Core Reasons "Free Skill" Systems Often Struggle

Here’s a deeper dive into the "why," which will lead us to the solutions.

1.  **The Paradox of Choice & Analysis Paralysis:**
    *   **Skill Tree:** Presents a limited, curated set of 2-3 choices at any given moment. This is manageable and reduces stress.
    *   **Free System:** Presents the entire roster of skills at every level-up. This can be overwhelming. The player spends more time stressing about the "perfect" choice than feeling excited about their new power. This is a well-documented psychological effect.

2.  **Lack of Visible Progression & The "Carrot on a Stick":**
    *   **Skill Tree:** It's a visual progression map. Filling out a branch is satisfying. Seeing a powerful "capstone" skill at the end of a tree gives you a tangible, long-term goal. It's a "carrot on a stick" that pulls you forward.
    *   **Free System:** Progression is invisible. Your character is stronger, but there's no visual representation of your journey. The next goal is always just "the next level," which is abstract and less compelling than a specific, named skill.

3.  **Reduced Sense of Specialization and Identity:**
    *   **Skill Tree:** The choices you make *early on* define your path. Choosing the "Warrior" branch over the "Mage" branch creates a unique identity. You see a player with a massive two-handed sword and you know the *journey* they took to get it.
    *   **Free System:** While it allows for more flexibility, it can lead to "homogenization" or a feeling that choices are less meaningful. If everyone can potentially have everything (or anything) at any time, the choices made at level 5 feel less consequential to your character's identity.

4.  **The Planning & Theorycrafting Mini-Game:**
    *   **Skill Tree:** Players love to plan builds outside the game. They use online planners, discuss optimal paths, and get excited about achieving a specific build at max level. This engagement extends beyond the game itself.
    *   **Free System:** This mini-game is almost entirely absent. There's nothing to plan because the path is open. You've removed a significant source of community engagement and player investment.

5.  **Lower Perceived Value of Individual Skills:**
    *   **Skill Tree:** To unlock a powerful skill, you often have to "invest" 3-5 points into a branch. This investment increases the perceived value and payoff of that final skill.
    *   **Free System:** If you get the most powerful skill in the game for "free" at a high level, it doesn't feel like an earned reward for a dedicated journey. It just feels like a number was reached.

---

### How to Fix It: Bridging the Gap Between Freedom and Engagement

You don't have to abandon your philosophy of freedom. You need to **scaffold** it with the psychological hooks that make skill trees engaging.

#### Solution 1: The "Web" or "Cluster" System (Structured Freedom)
Instead of a tree, present skills as a web or cluster. Skills are grouped by theme (e.g., "Pyromancy," "Stealth," "Guardian"), but within a cluster, you can learn them in any order.
*   **Why it works:** It retains player freedom but provides a visual structure and clear "archetypes." It creates short-term goals ("I want to complete this Pyromancy cluster") while allowing for cross-cluster hybridization.

#### Solution 2: The "Skill Point Buy" System with Prerequisites
This is a hybrid model. You get free skill points, but skills have prerequisites.
*   **Example:** To learn "Fireball II," you need *any 3* Tier-1 Fire skills. To learn "Meteor Swarm," you need *any 2* Tier-2 Fire skills.
*   **Why it works:** It maintains a huge amount of freedom (you choose which Tier-1 skills to take) but creates a clear progression ladder and long-term goals. It encourages unique combinations without being completely open.

#### Solution 3: Make the "Free Choice" a "Meaningful Choice" with Synergies
Design skills to have powerful, explicit synergies with each other. The game should actively teach the player about these synergies.
*   **Example:** "If you have *Frost Nova* and *Flame Dash*, create a Steam Cloud on impact." The player's goal becomes discovering and collecting these synergistic pairs, not just filling a bar.
*   **Why it works:** It turns the level-up screen from a "what's the best standalone skill?" into a "which piece of the puzzle do I need next?" This creates its own form of long-term planning and goal-setting.

#### Solution 4: Double Down on the "Experimenter's Paradise"
If freedom is your core pillar, you must make experimentation its own reward.
*   **Integrate Respecs Deeply:** Don't just have a reset feature. Make it cheap, easy, and encouraged. Have an NPC who says, "Adventurer, try this new combo!" and offers a free respec.
*   **Provide Build Challenges:** Have in-game goals like "Complete the Ice Cavern using only Lightning skills" or "Defeat the Boss using a build with no two skills from the same school." This gives players a *reason* to experiment.
*   **Showcase Possibilities:** Have a "Testing Grounds" where players can try any skill at any time before committing their points.

### Conclusion

The issue isn't that players inherently hate freedom. It's that **unstructured freedom can feel like aimlessness.**

**Your key takeaway:** Players don't just want *power*; they want a *journey to power* that feels planned, earned, and visually represented.

You can have a free system, but you must provide:
*   **Visual Goals:** A map (even a non-linear one) to follow.
*   **Meaningful Milestones:** Big, satisfying payoffs for investment.
*   **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Curated choices, not overwhelming ones.

Try implementing one of the hybrid solutions above. You'll likely see engagement return because you'll be giving players the best of both worlds: the freedom they crave, with the structure they need to enjoy it.
