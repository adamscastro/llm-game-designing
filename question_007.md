## Problem Description
So what's the point of durability? ‚Äî Like from a game design standpoint, is there really a point in durability other than padding play time due to having to get more materials? I don't think there's been a single game I've played where I went "man this game would be a whole lot more fun if I had to go and fix my tools every now and then" or even "man I really enjoy the fact that my tools break if I use them too much". Sure there's the whole realism thing, but I feel like that's not a very good reason to add something to a game, so I figured I'd ask here if there's any reason to durability in games other than extending play time and 'realism'

## Best Human-rated Answer
Implementation varies greatly and I'm not a massive fan of it in general - but it does offer more to gameplay than realism / passing play time:

- Breaks players out of set patterns and encourages explortation ("ok, guess i can't mine any more until i fix this pick axe...but i dont have enough resources. maybe i'll go explore that new area ive been putting off")

- Forces players to adapt their strategy ("my sword just broke - looks like i'll have to fall back on using this tree branch. oh, wait... there's a fire over there - this just got interesting!"). This encourages emergent play styles, which is basically the BOTW model.

- Can introduce additional mechanics - e.g. in BOTW, weapons close to breaking deal double damage when thrown, if they shatter on the enemy (which is a nice design option to soften the blow of losing good gear. its almost like the game world being like 'hey, sorry your cool sword is a goner' - here's an opportunity to send it on it's way in the most satisfying way possible)

- Opens up more options for balancing progression and item economy to the designer (strength v durability v cost)

- Introduces more choices for the player - should i repair this now? or just save the resources and craft a stronger option?

- Introduces some risk v rewards ‚Äîshould a player use their best weapon now, or save it for later?

Worth noting that durability mechanics can be obfuscated a little - e.g. the sharpening mechanic in Monster Hunter. Though it's different to the implementation you're talking about, it's still a type of durability, which requires you to manage your time and the flow of combat to counteract it (e.g. by creating a distraction, changing position, or switching to an alternative means of dealing damage until you have time to sharpen)

In survival crafting games, it does all of the above while also serving to reinforce the endless loop of resource gathering and crafting - so its almost a nesseccary evil if you want to make one of those games. In games which are more linear and finite, I find it abit more annoying - but its all personal preference

### ChatGPT-5 Response
That‚Äôs a great (and common!) design question ‚Äî durability systems in games are often controversial because they can easily feel like *tedium* instead of *depth*. But they **can** serve meaningful design purposes when implemented with intent and balance. Here are several design goals and approaches where durability actually adds value ‚Äî and how a developer can make it feel less like ‚Äúpadding.‚Äù

---

### üéØ 1. **Resource Management & Decision-Making**

**Design purpose:** Force players to make trade-offs and plan ahead.

* **Example:** In *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, durability encourages experimentation ‚Äî players constantly adapt to new weapons rather than relying on one overpowered sword.
* **How to make it feel good:**

  * Ensure replacement options are always within reach.
  * Make different tools meaningful (not just stat reskins).
  * Let durability shape short-term tactics (e.g., saving a high-damage weapon for bosses).

---

### üß∞ 2. **Economy Balancing**

**Design purpose:** Create a sink for resources and currency.

* In RPGs or survival games, durability adds *value flow* ‚Äî materials and money stay relevant longer.
* **Without it:** Players often reach a point where resources have no use, breaking economic balance.
* **Tip:** Tie repairs to *player skill* or *infrastructure upgrades* so players feel rewarded for investing in maintenance systems.

---

### ‚öîÔ∏è 3. **Encouraging Item Variety & Experimentation**

**Design purpose:** Prevent players from sticking to ‚Äúthe best‚Äù gear forever.

* Durability can *nudge players* to use different tools, weapons, or playstyles.
* **Better design:** Instead of punishing wear-out, *reward adaptation* ‚Äî maybe broken items can be reforged into unique variants or used as crafting ingredients.

---

### üß≠ 4. **Creating Survival Tension**

**Design purpose:** Support immersion and tension in survival or exploration contexts.

* Limited durability in survival games (*Subnautica*, *The Long Dark*) heightens tension and gives weight to resource scarcity.
* Works best when aligned with the game‚Äôs fantasy ‚Äî if the core loop is about managing limited means, durability fits naturally.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 5. **Narrative or Thematic Integration**

**Design purpose:** Reinforce the story or emotional tone.

* A world in decay ‚Üí weapons and tools deteriorate too.
* A game about perseverance ‚Üí maintaining your gear parallels the protagonist‚Äôs struggle.
* Example: *Dark Souls* uses durability to emphasize fragility and consequence in a bleak world.

---

### üß© 6. **Alternative Design Approaches**

If you *don‚Äôt* want traditional durability but still want its benefits:

* **Soft durability:** Tools lose efficiency instead of breaking.
* **Repair-on-use:** Let durability drain fuel a ‚Äúmoment of decision‚Äù mechanic (e.g., risk breaking for a big hit).
* **Regenerative durability:** Weapons recharge slowly when unused, encouraging rotation without punishment.
* **Decay as customization:** Players can specialize in maintaining gear (crafting skill trees, perks, etc.).

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è 7. **When to *Not* Use Durability**

Sometimes durability *is* just padding. It‚Äôs usually not a good fit if:

* The core loop already has enough resource management.
* The game emphasizes power fantasy or uninterrupted flow (e.g., action games, fast-paced shooters).
* The durability system doesn‚Äôt meaningfully interact with other systems.

---

### üß† In Short

Durability works **only if it meaningfully connects to your game‚Äôs core loop or theme**:

> ‚ÄúDoes this system make the player think, plan, or feel something that supports the rest of the game?‚Äù

If the answer is no ‚Äî skip it, or replace it with a mechanic that achieves those same design goals in a more enjoyable way.

---

Would you like me to give **examples of well-designed vs. poorly designed durability systems** from real games? That can help clarify what works and what doesn‚Äôt.


### Gemini Response
This is a classic and very valid game design question. You're right‚Äîwhen implemented poorly, durability feels exactly like you described: pointless padding, a chore, and an arbitrary barrier to fun.

However, when used thoughtfully, durability is a powerful tool to drive specific player behaviors and create interesting design dynamics. It's not about "realism"; it's about *consequences* and *choices*.

Here are the primary game design reasons to use a durability system, *other* than padding or realism.

### 1. To Force Meaningful Strategic Choices

This is the most important reason. Durability turns an item from a static "thing I have" into a "resource I am spending." This creates tension and forces strategic trade-offs.

* **The "Good Potion" Problem:** Think of RPGs where you save all your "Megalixirs" for the final boss and end up never using them. Durability solves this for equipment.
* **The Choice:** "I just found a powerful Glass Cannon sword that does massive damage but breaks in 5 hits. Do I use it to clear this tough-but-optional miniboss, or do I save it for the area boss I *know* is coming up?"
* **The Consequence:** Without durability, there's no choice. You just use your best weapon all the time. With durability, every swing of that powerful weapon has a *cost*, making the decision to use it a meaningful strategic one.

### 2. To Promote Player Adaptation and Variety

Durability is one of the most effective tools to break the "one optimal loadout" problem.

* **The Problem:** In many games (like *Skyrim*), a player finds the "best" sword, enchants it, and then uses that *one weapon* for the next 40 hours, ignoring 90% of the loot they find because it's "worse."
* **The Solution:** In *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, your awesome Royal Claymore *will* break. This is frustrating, but by design. It *forces* you to pick up that Bokoblin club or that rusty halberd you'd otherwise ignore. It compels you to engage with the game's full arsenal, mastering different weapon types, and constantly adapting your playstyle based on what you have. It turns "loot" from "junk to sell" into "my next potential weapon."

### 3. As an Economic & Resource Sink

In any game with an economy, you need "sinks" (ways for money/resources to leave the game) to balance the "faucets" (ways to earn them). If you don't, currency becomes worthless.

* **The Problem:** In an MMO or a long RPG, the player eventually accumulates millions of gold pieces, but there's nothing left to buy. Money becomes meaningless, and so do all the quests that reward it.
* **The Solution:** Repair costs (like in *World of Warcraft* or *Diablo*) are a constant, low-level drain on the economy. It's a background "tax" for playing the game. This helps keep the currency valuable and gives a baseline purpose to earning money, even in the endgame. It's also a way to drain crafting materials, keeping those loops relevant.

### 4. To Create Pacing and Tension (The Survival Loop)

In survival-crafting games, durability is fundamental to the entire game loop.

* **The Loop:** The core fantasy of *Minecraft* or *Don't Starve* is about taming a hostile world.
* **The Tension:** You're deep in a cave. You just found a vein of diamonds. Your iron pickaxe is in the red. You hear a zombie. Do you risk mining the diamonds, hoping your pickaxe doesn't break? Or do you run back to your base to craft a new one, risking losing your way?
* **The Purpose:** The *threat* of your tools breaking creates a new layer of problems to solve. It's not just "do I have the tool?" but "do I have *enough tool*?" It forces you to plan, prepare, and manage your expeditions. The *relief* of making it back to base with 1 durability left is a powerful emotional beat.

### 5. As a Lever for Meaningful Progression

Durability can be a reward system in itself. The "pain point" it creates can be "solved" by player progression, which feels great.

* **The Progression:**
    1.  **Start:** Your "Crude Flint Axe" breaks after 10 trees. This is a hassle.
    2.  **Mid-Game:** You unlock the "Sturdy Iron Axe." It lasts for 100 trees. This feels like a *massive* quality-of-life upgrade, far more impactful than just chopping 10% faster.
    3.  **End-Game:** You find a magic enchantment ("Mending" in *Minecraft*) that makes your tool repair itself, or you craft a legendary "Unbreakable" tool.
* **The Reward:** You haven't just gotten stronger; you have *transcended* a core problem. You've earned convenience. This feels more satisfying than just getting another `+5 Attack`.

### How to Solve the "It's Not Fun" Problem

Your core complaint is that durability *feels* bad. This is a failure of *implementation*, not concept. Here are ways to get the design benefits without the player frustration:

1.  **Distinguish: "Breaks" vs. "Needs Repair."**
    * **Breaks (e.g., *Breath of the Wild*):** The item is gone forever. This is high-stakes and forces variety, but it can feel *very* bad if the item was unique or hard to get. This works best when cool items are common.
    * **Needs Repair (e.g., *Dark Souls*, *The Witcher 3*):** The item becomes weak or unusable ("At Risk"), but it can be restored for a cost (currency or materials). This is much less punishing. It serves as an economic sink and a gentle nudge to return to a "hub" (like a bonfire or a blacksmith), which helps control game pacing.

2.  **Give the Player Agency and Warning.**
    * **Never** have an item break without clear warning. A simple UI (a durability bar, a "cracked" icon) is essential.
    * Give the player an *in-game* way to manage it. The *Mending* enchantment in *Minecraft* is a brilliant design: it repairs items using XP. It turns durability from a "chore you stop to do" into something that is *passively managed by playing the game*.

3.  **Make Repair/Replacement Accessible (Not a Grind).**
    * **Bad:** "Your sword broke. To fix it, you must stop what you're doing and go hunt 10 'Scrap Weasels' in the starting zone." This is padding.
    * **Good:** "Your sword broke. You can fix it at any blacksmith for 100 gold (which you get from normal play) or with a 'Repair Kit' (which you can craft from common materials you're already gathering)."

4.  **Tie Durability to Risk/Reward.**
    * In *Dark Souls*, your weapons are repaired *for free* every time you rest at a bonfire. The only *real* risk is if a weapon breaks *in the middle of a level*. This creates tension in the field but doesn't create a resource-grinding chore back at the hub.
    * Consider special moves that cost *extra* durability. Now the player has a choice: "Do I use my standard, 'free' attack, or do I spend my weapon's 'health' to unleash this powerful spinning move?"

**In summary:** Durability is a *cost-design* tool. You're asking the player to "spend" a resource (the item's lifespan) in exchange for power or efficiency. The key is to make that cost create an *interesting choice*, not just an annoying tax.

### DeepSeek Response
Of course. This is a fantastic and very common game design question. The user is right to be skeptical, as durability is often implemented poorly. However, when done well, it serves several crucial gameplay functions beyond simple time-padding.

Here are the key game design reasons for including a durability system, framed as suggestions for the developer.

### 1. To Create a Sink for Resources (The Core Gameplay Loop)
This is the most common and valid reason, but it's often misunderstood. It's not just about "padding time"; it's about **giving value to the core activities of the game.**

*   **Problem without Durability:** In a survival/crafting game, once a player has the best pickaxe, why would they ever mine iron or chop wood again? Those core loops become obsolete.
*   **Solution with Durability:** Durability makes basic resources perpetually relevant. It ensures that the player always has a reason to engage with the early and mid-game content, which is often the bulk of the game's world.
*   **How to frame it to players:** "Durability ensures that gathering and crafting remain meaningful activities throughout your entire journey, not just the beginning."

### 2. To Encourage Variety and Experimentation
A broken tool can force a player out of their comfort zone.

*   **Problem without Durability:** A player finds a weapon they're good with (e.g., a powerful sword) and uses it exclusively for 50 hours, ignoring spears, axes, magic staves, etc.
*   **Solution with Durability:** If that sword breaks and needs repair, the player might pick up that electric hammer they've been ignoring. They might discover a new favorite playstyle or a tool better suited for a specific enemy.
*   **How to frame it:** "Durability encourages you to master multiple weapon types and adapt your strategy on the fly, making you a more versatile adventurer."

### 3. To Manage Player Power and Pace Progression
Durability can be a subtle tool for game balance.

*   **Problem without Durability:** A player gets incredibly lucky and finds an end-game weapon in the first hour. This trivializes all challenge and ruins the intended progression curve.
*   **Solution with Durability:** That powerful weapon can have low durability or require rare materials to repair. This allows the player to have a "taste" of power without letting them keep it forever, breaking the game's balance. It becomes a strategic resource to be used in emergencies.
*   **How to frame it:** "Finding a powerful artifact is exciting, but its limited durability means you must choose the perfect moment to unleash its full potential, creating memorable 'clutch' moments."

### 4. To Add a Layer of Strategic Resource Management
This turns inventory management from a chore into a puzzle.

*   **Problem without Durability:** Inventory management is just about hoarding the "best" stuff.
*   **Solution with Durability:** The player must ask: "Do I have enough resources to repair my gear for this long dungeon delve? Should I bring backup weapons? Is it worth using my best axe on this regular tree, or should I use a cheaper one?" This creates meaningful choices.
*   **How to frame it:** "Durability adds a strategic layer to exploration. Preparing for a journey by ensuring your tools are in good repair is part of the adventure."

### 5. To Enhance the "Survival" Fantasy and Tension
In specific genres, durability is key to the atmosphere.

*   **Problem without Durability:** A "survival" game where your gear is permanent loses a core element of the genre‚Äîthe struggle against entropy and the environment.
*   **Solution with Durability:** The fear of your last weapon breaking while lost in a zombie-infested forest creates immense tension. The relief of finding a simple screwdriver to scavenge parts with is a genuine triumph. It makes the world feel hostile and the player's position fragile.
*   **How to frame it:** "In a survival setting, the degradation of your gear reinforces the core theme: the world is working against you, and your ingenuity in maintaining your equipment is key to staying alive."

### How to Implement Durability in a Way That *Doesn't* Annoy Players

The user's frustration usually stems from bad implementations. Here‚Äôs how to do it right:

1.  **Make Repair Convenient:** Don't force the player to trek back to a specific town and talk to three different NPCs just to repair. Allow field repairs, or have repair stations at fast-travel points.
2.  **Give Clear Feedback:** Have a clear, always-visible durability meter. Don't let tools break without ample warning. A "red" state that lasts for a while is better than an instant shatter.
3.  **Avoid the "Punishment" Feeling:** When a tool breaks, it shouldn't vanish. It should become a "Broken Pickaxe" that can be repaired at a cost, rather than forcing the player to craft a brand new one from scratch.
4.  **Balance the Decay Rate:** This is the most crucial part. The rate of decay must feel fair relative to the gameplay loop. If it breaks too fast, it feels like a chore. If it never breaks, the system is pointless.
5.  **Offer Mitigation or Mastery:** Let players invest in skills or find enchantments that slow degradation, giving them a sense of progression and eventual mastery over the system.
6.  **Consider Alternatives:**
    *   **The "Breath of the Wild" Model:** Tools are abundant and disposable, encouraging improvisation.
    *   **The "Degradation, not Destruction" Model:** Tools never break, but their effectiveness drops significantly when in need of repair (e.g., dealing 50% less damage).
    *   **The "Whetstone/Oil" Model:** Instead of durability, weapons need to be maintained to keep their peak performance. Letting them go unmaintained has a penalty, but they never vanish.

**Conclusion for the Developer:**

Don't think of durability as "realism" or "playtime padding." Frame it as a **system that creates interesting choices, enforces the core gameplay loop, and encourages strategic play.** The goal is to make the player think about their resources and tools, not to simply inconvenience them. If the system feels like a fun puzzle rather than a chore, you've implemented it correctly.
