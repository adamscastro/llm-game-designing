## Problem Description
What's the point in creating meaningless areas to the player? ‚Äî I feel like my title doesn't really explain my question that well but I couldn't think of a short way to ask this.

I've been playing South of Midnight and so far its been a pretty great time, but I've noticed a few instances of a level design choice that I've seen in a bunch of other games that I've never been able to understand. They will have areas that the player can go to that don't really serve a purpose, there would be no collectable there or a good view of the environment or anything. I struggle to figure out a reason that they would let the player go to that area.

For example, in South of Midnight there are explorable interiors were the movement speed is slowed down a bit and the player is meant to look around and read notes and interact with the environment. One of these interiors was a two-story house, but when I went up the staircase it lead to a blocked off door. Why would they put the stairs there in the first place? Why make the house a two-story house?

The only answers I can think of are that they want environments to feel more real so they include areas like that, or maybe there was a plan to put something there but it got scrapped.

Am I overthinking this? Or is there a point to these kinds of areas in games

## Best Human-rated Answer
I've heard The Witcher 3 has tons of buildings in major cities that you can't enter. They're there to make the world feel bigger. There's also something to be said for adding mystery to the world, stuff like that makes you wonder whether there's something intended for this later.

Lastly, you only feel a sense of freedom when you have choices. Dead space can offer a sliver of freedom, even if it's hollow, by the simple fact that you're allowed to go there when the game doesn't technically want you to. That means the player chose to go there, so the player feels a little sense of freedom in that. It could be done much better of course, but it's another reason it might be there.

### ChatGPT-5 Response
That‚Äôs a great and very common game design question ‚Äî and the developer‚Äôs intuition is good: those ‚Äúmeaningless‚Äù areas are rarely actually meaningless, even if they seem that way to the player.

Here are several **reasons why designers intentionally include ‚Äúempty‚Äù or inaccessible areas**, and how to **use them effectively** instead of letting them feel like wasted space:

---

### üé≠ 1. **Worldbuilding and Believability**

Real environments aren‚Äôt built around the player‚Äôs needs ‚Äî they exist *for themselves*.

* A two-story house *should* have stairs, even if the second floor isn‚Äôt explorable.
* This sells the illusion that the world existed before the player showed up.
* It gives locations an internal logic, which increases immersion and credibility.

‚úÖ **Design tip:**
If a space exists purely for realism, make it visually or thematically contribute ‚Äî use lighting, architecture, or sound design to *hint at life beyond the play area* (e.g. muffled footsteps upstairs, a flickering light under the blocked door).

---

### üß≠ 2. **Player Curiosity and Exploration Psychology**

Exploring dead ends and finding nothing is part of how players *map* a space mentally.

* These moments teach boundaries: ‚ÄúThis is as far as I can go here.‚Äù
* They create rhythm ‚Äî curiosity, exploration, then closure.
* Constant rewards make exploration *predictable* and flatten pacing.

‚úÖ **Design tip:**
Use ‚Äúempty‚Äù areas to shape player expectations. A few unrewarded detours make actual discoveries feel more special and earned.

---

### üé¨ 3. **Pacing, Mood, and Tone**

Spaces with no ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù can be used to manage emotional tempo.

* After a tense sequence, an empty hallway or abandoned room can give the player a breather.
* Conversely, emptiness can create unease or loneliness.
* Slower movement and silence can reinforce tone (e.g. grief, mystery, decay).

‚úÖ **Design tip:**
Think of empty areas as ‚Äúrests‚Äù in a piece of music. They make the beats that follow hit harder.

---

### üß© 4. **Development and Scope Management**

Sometimes, yes ‚Äî content gets cut. But those spaces may remain for good reasons:

* Removing them could break navigation, lighting, or set dressing flow.
* Keeping the structure intact maintains consistency in world layout.
* It can be faster to block off a door than rebuild geometry.

‚úÖ **Design tip:**
If an area exists due to scrapped content, polish its closure: make the blockade feel *intentional* (e.g. collapsed ceiling, nailed door, or story reason).

---

### üß† 5. **Player Memory and Spatial Cohesion**

Humans remember places through landmarks and paths.
A staircase to a locked door might subconsciously help the player *anchor* their understanding of the building layout.
Even unused spaces make the environment feel spatially coherent.

‚úÖ **Design tip:**
When designing interiors, ensure every area contributes to spatial storytelling, even if it‚Äôs not interactable.

---

### üå± 6. **Thematic or Narrative Implications**

Sometimes emptiness itself tells a story.
A boarded-up floor might imply danger, decay, or abandonment ‚Äî world details that enrich the narrative texture without words.

‚úÖ **Design tip:**
Ask: ‚ÄúWhat emotion or thought should this empty space evoke?‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúWhat loot should be here?‚Äù

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è In Short

You‚Äôre not overthinking it ‚Äî *but you may be thinking only in terms of gameplay utility*.
Good level design balances **functional space** (for play) and **expressive space** (for meaning and immersion).
Even ‚Äúpointless‚Äù areas serve *thematic, emotional, or spatial* purposes.

---

If you were advising a designer with this issue, here‚Äôs a concise summary you could give them:

> **Don‚Äôt remove meaningless spaces ‚Äî give them meaning.**
> They can:
>
> * Make the world feel real
> * Teach boundaries
> * Control pacing
> * Support mood or story
> * Anchor player navigation
> * Suggest a larger world beyond the player‚Äôs reach

Would you like me to show some **examples of how top studios use ‚Äúempty‚Äù spaces effectively** (like in *The Last of Us*, *Dark Souls*, or *Resident Evil*)?

### Gemini Response
This is an excellent question, and you are absolutely not overthinking it. You're thinking like a level designer, and your two initial answers are two of the most common and correct reasons.

This "problem" of "meaningless areas" is a classic topic in level design. What you're often seeing is a deliberate choice, and understanding the different reasons *why* can make you a stronger designer.

Here are the most common reasons for these "pointless" areas, ranging from high-level artistic choice to simple production reality.

### 1. World-Building and Immersion (Your "Realism" Guess)

This is probably the most important reason. A world that is 100% efficient, where every single path leads to a collectible or a quest, feels incredibly artificial. It feels like a video game "level" or a theme park ride, not a *place*.

* **Verisimilitude:** Real places have "useless" spaces. Real houses have closets you don't need to open, hallways that just lead to other rooms, and, yes, stairs that lead to floors you have no reason to visit. In your example, the building *looks* like a two-story house from the outside. If you went inside and there were no stairs, it would feel fake and break immersion. Adding the stairs and blocking the door maintains the illusion that this is a real, complete house, even if the *gameplay* only happens on the first floor.
* **Environmental Storytelling:** The "nothing" *is* the point. A blocked door is a story in itself. Why is it blocked? Is something being kept *in*? Or *out*? In a game like *South of Midnight* (which has a Southern Gothic, supernatural vibe), a blocked-off part of a house is *loaded* with narrative potential. It creates mystery and atmosphere far more effectively than an empty room with a single ammo clip in it. The "reward" isn't an item; it's a *question* planted in your head.

### 2. Pacing and Player Psychology

Games that are 100% "on" all the time are exhausting. Constant rewards, constant combat, and constant "interest" can lead to sensory overload.

* **"Negative Space":** In art, negative space is the empty area *around* the subject, which helps to define the subject itself. In level design, these "pointless" areas are a form of negative space. They are the "silence between the notes." These quiet moments of non-discovery make the *actual* discoveries feel more significant. If you found a collectible down every single path, they would stop feeling special.
* **Managing Tension:** In suspense or horror games, a long hallway that leads to *nothing* is a masterpiece of tension. The player creeps down it, *expecting* a jump scare, their anxiety building with every step. When they find nothing, there's a moment of relief, but now they are even more on edge for the *next* hallway. The "point" of the area was to manipulate the player's emotional state.
* **The "Red Herring":** Sometimes, a path is designed to look important to intentionally mislead the player, perhaps to make the *actual* hidden path (which looked unimportant) more rewarding to find.

### 3. Level Flow and Player Guidance

This sounds counter-intuitive, but a clear dead end can be a powerful tool for guiding the player.

* **Closing a Loop:** A player who sees a two-story house will *want* to know if they can go upstairs. If you just remove the stairs, they might spend 10 minutes outside the house trying to find another way up, convinced they're missing a secret. By putting the stairs in and adding a *clear, blocked door*, the designer is explicitly telling the player: "Yes, an upstairs exists, but no, you cannot go there. You have seen everything here. You can stop looking and move on." It respects the player's time by providing a clear "no" instead of an ambiguous "maybe."

### 4. Production Realities (Your "Scrapped Content" Guess)

This is also extremely common. Game development is a messy process of iteration, cutting, and tight deadlines.

* **Cut Content:** You're spot on. A designer fully intended to build out that second floor. It was going to have a key story item and three diary entries. But 3 weeks before the deadline, it was clear there wasn't time. The *fastest, cheapest* solution? Don't delete the staircase (which is part of the house "prefab" asset); just add a "blocked door" asset at the top.
* **Modular Asset Re-use:** The art team built a beautiful "two-story farmhouse" asset. The level designer needs 10 farmhouses for their map. 8 of them are just background scenery, 1 of them is fully explorable, and for *your* house, the designer only needed the first floor for a small story beat. Instead of asking the art team to make a brand-new, one-story version (which costs time and money), they just use the existing two-story asset and block the stairs.

### So, what's the takeaway for you as a developer?

You *can* and *should* use "meaningless" areas deliberately in your own designs. Don't think of them as pointless, think of them as tools:

* **Use them for Immersion:** Add a small side room, a closet, or a balcony that has nothing but a chair. It makes the space feel lived-in.
* **Use them for Pacing:** After an intense combat, create a small, quiet path that just leads to a nice view (or even nothing at all) to let the player breathe.
* **Use them for Storytelling:** A caved-in mine shaft, a locked high-tech door, a magically sealed portal. These are "dead ends" that tell a story and build your world's lore.
* **Use them for Guidance:** Be clear with your dead ends. A blocked door is better than a
    path that just... stops, leaving the player wondering if they missed a jump or a "use" prompt.

You're not overthinking it at all. You're just starting to see the "invisible" layers of intentional design.

### DeepSeek Response
Of course. This is an excellent and very common question in game design critique. You are definitely not overthinking it; this touches on a core tension in game development: the balance between a curated, purposeful experience and creating a believable, explorable world.

The issue you're describing‚Äîseemingly "meaningless" areas‚Äîcan be intentional, unintentional, or a bit of both. Here are the possible reasons, broken down into categories, along with suggestions for how a developer might address them.

---

### Part 1: The "Why" - Possible Reasons for These Areas

#### A. Intentional Design Choices (The "Good" Reasons)

1.  **Environmental Storytelling & Verisimilitude:** This is the most likely reason for the two-story house with a blocked staircase. A house in real life has a second floor. By including it (even if inaccessible), the developers are building a world that feels *lived-in* and *coherent*, rather than a mere video game level. The blocked door itself tells a micro-story: "This family didn't use the upstairs," or "There's been a collapse," or "This area is private." It makes the world exist beyond the player's direct interaction.

2.  **Pacing and Mood:** The slowed movement in the interiors of *South of Midnight* is a classic pacing technique. A large, empty, or quiet space can create a moment of calm, tension, or melancholy. It gives the player's brain a break from constant action or puzzle-solving and allows the atmosphere to sink in. A long, empty hallway can build dread; a peaceful, empty meadow can provide respite.

3.  **Player Curiosity and Reward:** Sometimes, the "reward" for exploring a dead end is *the view itself*. A breathtaking vista, a clever piece of environmental art, or a quiet, hidden moment can be its own reward. It makes the player feel like a true explorer rather than just a collectible-hunting machine. If every single path leads to a tangible reward, exploration becomes predictable and transactional.

4.  **Red Herrings and World-Building:** Not every path should lead to treasure. In a real world, you would occasionally open a closet and find it empty. Having dead ends or empty spaces makes the world feel less like a theme park designed solely for the player's benefit. It makes the *meaningful* discoveries feel more special because the player had to sift through the mundane to find them.

5.  **Future-Proofing / Setting a Foundation:** The developers might be intentionally creating a layout that can be easily expanded in a DLC or sequel. That blocked door in the first game could be the entrance to a new area in the next.

#### B. Unintentional or Practical Reasons (The "Bad" Reasons)

1.  **Content Cut:** This is a very common reality of game development. You are correct‚Äîthere might have been a collectible, a note, or a side-room planned for that upstairs area, but it was cut due to time, budget, or technical constraints. Removing the stairs entirely would have been more work than just blocking the door, so the "scaffolding" of the intended design remains.

2.  **Level Design Inconsistency:** Sometimes, different parts of a level are built by different designers. One designer might build a beautiful, realistic house layout, and another might be tasked with placing the gameplay elements. A miscommunication or lack of polish can lead to spaces that feel unfinished.

3.  **Technical Constraints:** The area beyond the door might have been too demanding on the game's engine, causing frame rate drops. The easiest fix during development is sometimes to just wall it off.

4.  **Guiding the Player (Done Poorly):** A blocked path is a very clear signal: "Don't go this way." However, if it breaks the internal logic of the world (like a perfectly normal-looking door in a house being inexplicably blocked), it feels artificial and lazy.

---

### Part 2: Solutions for the Game Developer

If a developer is facing this issue and wants to improve the player experience, here are some ways to make these areas feel more purposeful.

#### 1. Add Micro-Interactions or "Easter Eggs"
Instead of leaving a dead-end completely empty, add a tiny, non-essential reward.
*   A unique, non-collectible object to look at (a child's drawing, a strange stain on the wall, a unique piece of furniture).
*   A subtle sound (the hum of a broken appliance, wind whistling through a crack).
*   A line of unique dialogue from the protagonist ("Looks like no one's been up here in years...").

#### 2. Enhance the Environmental Storytelling
If an area is going to be a dead end, make the *reason* for the dead end part of the story.
*   Don't just have a blocked door. Have it **barricaded from the other side** with furniture, suggesting a desperate last stand.
*   Have the staircase **collapse** as the player reaches the top, making the blockage dynamic and memorable.
*   Put a **"Condemned"** notice or warning signs on the door.

#### 3. Use Visual Storytelling as the Reward
Ensure that the dead end offers a compelling visual.
*   Frame the area so that when the player turns around, they get a stunning, unique view of the level they just traversed.
*   Have a window at the end of the blocked hall that reveals a key landmark or tells a story about the outside world.

#### 4. Justify the Emptiness
Acknowledge the emptiness through gameplay or narrative.
*   In a survival game, an empty cupboard could be a reminder of scarcity.
*   The player character could mutter, "Nothing here. I should keep moving," which validates the player's effort and makes the emptiness feel intentional.

#### 5. The "Polish" Pass
Before shipping, do a dedicated pass through the game looking specifically for these "empty" spaces. Ask:
*   "Does this area support the mood or pacing?"
*   "If it's a dead end, does its *reason for being blocked* make sense in the world?"
*   "Can I add a 5-second audio/visual detail here to make the trip worthwhile?"

### Conclusion

You are right to notice this. For a player, the contract is that their curiosity should be rewarded. The developer's job is to decide what form that reward takes: it doesn't always have to be loot or a collectible. It can be a story, a mood, a moment of peace, or a laugh.

The best game worlds are the ones that make their "empty" spaces feel as intentional as their combat arenas. The key is to ensure that the player never feels their time was *wasted*, only that they were immersed in a world that feels larger and more real than the sum of its gameplay parts.
