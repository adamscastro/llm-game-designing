## Question 031

Question's subreddit link: https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1m0ynq9/why_dont_we_see_more_games_with_meaningful_time

## Problem Description
Why don‚Äôt we see more games with meaningful time progression (seasons. Etc.), and what are the biggest challenges in making them? ‚Äî I‚Äôm curious why more games don‚Äôt fully embrace day by day forward-moving time as a core design element. Imagine RPG worlds where:

NPCs age, have kids, or die over a select amount of time.

Cities expand, decay, or change political control.

Seasons and yearly events reshape gameplay and strategy.

Your choices are seen across a specific period of time.

So, my questions are broadly:

What makes significant time progression hard to design? What genres could benefit most from evolving worlds? Is it technical limitations, player patience, or dev priorities that keep most games static? What games already do this really well that I should look into?

EDIT: in the context of my concept: 1 year (made of only 62 days) across all seasons and events take place in real time, divided in segments (so, not literally 1 hour = 1day, it could be 45 min depending on the events the player is engaging with).

The goal is to create an alternative sense of choice in an RPG context, where you can create events or get manipulated by them in real time, allowing the player an open space for them to come in an engage with a specific story at any point in it's stages (which is hard to do but doable), creating this real world feel, it's alot of work but some things to note, is that the game is a pure RPG and doesn't have freedom of movement or complicated game mechanics or physics system, the game has relatively nice 2D art that just focus on the story and some fast time events when agility is required, the rest of the game is just countless portraits and dialogue showing and immersing you in the story, so no killing important NPCs or talking to important quest giver will squatting right on his desk while tryint to place a bucket on his head!

Another thing to note is that Npc sleep 31 hours of the 62 hour year on avarge, so i need to create events and stories for each region for those 31 hours.

## Best Human-rated Answer
Even doing day/night is hard enough that you absolutely do not want to do it unless it brings something significant to your plans for gameplay. They're all fantastic when it's a core part of the game. Stardew Valley is about managing your time on both the long and short scale, as an examples, so it's needed in a game like that, but for most games it's a whole lot of extra work for very little return.

So to answer your question simply, it's usually a waste of time and money.

### ChatGPT-5 Response
That‚Äôs a *great* design question ‚Äî and you‚Äôre actually thinking about one of the hardest but most rewarding areas of game design: **time as a systemic storytelling mechanic**. Let‚Äôs unpack your problem in a structured way, and then look at how you can *actually make it work* in your concept.

---

## üß≠ Why meaningful time progression is rare

Here are the biggest reasons you don‚Äôt see deep, systemic time progression in most games:

### 1. **Content explosion problem**

If every day, season, or year changes something in the world ‚Äî you‚Äôre effectively designing *multiple versions* of your world:

* Every city needs alternate states (peaceful, under siege, rebuilt, decayed‚Ä¶).
* Every NPC needs multiple possible life states (young ‚Üí adult ‚Üí old ‚Üí dead ‚Üí replaced).
* Quests and dialogues must account for when and how they happen (before/after certain events).

This multiplies production needs ‚Äî especially for story-driven games ‚Äî and requires huge writing, art, and scripting budgets.

‚úÖ **Your advantage:** since your game is 2D and dialogue-driven, you can script transitions and states more efficiently using variables and conditional dialogue rather than massive 3D environment changes.

---

### 2. **Player experience and pacing**

A real-time evolving world can frustrate players if they:

* Miss key events because they didn‚Äôt log in at the right time.
* Feel the world moves on without them, breaking the sense of agency.
* Are forced into ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù for something to happen.

This creates tension between *immersion* and *control*.

‚úÖ **Solution:** abstract time. As you said, ‚Äú1 day = 45 minutes depending on what you‚Äôre doing‚Äù ‚Äî perfect. Time can accelerate during events or slow down during dialogue. Use *time compression* to ensure important content remains accessible.

---

### 3. **Technical + systemic complexity**

For true progression, you need:

* Persistent world state management (save/load systems that record evolving changes).
* NPC scheduling or simulation (who‚Äôs where, doing what).
* Event scheduling (calendar-driven triggers that update the world).
* Asset management for visual changes (seasonal art swaps, event versions of scenes).

‚úÖ **Solution:** modular design.
Create:

* A **calendar system** that tracks global time.
* A **regional event manager** that fires ‚Äúseasonal updates‚Äù (e.g. winter adds snow palette + winter festivals).
* A **character state table** that tracks NPC arcs, e.g.:

  ```json
  {
    "npc_id": "mayor",
    "age": 42,
    "life_stage": "adult",
    "status": "alive",
    "flags": ["reelection_year"]
  }
  ```

  Then dialogue or portraits change based on this.

---

### 4. **Narrative cohesion**

If you allow large-scale progression, you risk narrative dissonance:

* Players might see plotlines ‚Äúskip ahead‚Äù before they‚Äôre resolved.
* NPCs who are dead in one timeline might appear alive in another.
* Players joining the story at different times might lose context.

‚úÖ **Solution:** design *time-aware narrative arcs*:

* Each story event has *windows of availability*.
* Use ‚Äúevent catch-up‚Äù sequences (summaries, flashbacks, or rumor dialogue) for late joiners.
* The player‚Äôs timeline should always make *personal sense*, even if the world moves independently.

---

## üå± Genres that benefit most from evolving worlds

* **Life sims / farm sims:** *Stardew Valley*, *Harvest Moon*, *Rune Factory*.
* **Strategy & management sims:** *Crusader Kings III*, *RimWorld*, *Dwarf Fortress*.
* **Narrative RPGs with persistent state:** *The Legend of Heroes* series, *Persona*, *Pathologic 2*, *Chrono Trigger*.
* **Immersive RPG-lites:** *Moonlighter*, *Undertale*, *Disco Elysium*.

These games use *time and consequence* as gameplay, not just flavor.

---

## üîß Practical design strategies for your concept

Since your game is **2D, story-heavy, and limited in mechanics**, you can *absolutely pull this off* with a few smart design principles:

### 1. **Segmented ‚ÄúTime Table‚Äù System**

Divide your 62-day year into clear *story phases* or ‚Äúworld beats.‚Äù
Example:

| Time Segment | Season   | Global Theme | Regional Events          |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Days 1‚Äì10    | Spring   | Renewal      | Festivals, planting      |
| Days 11‚Äì20   | Summer   | Prosperity   | Trade boom, rivalries    |
| Days 21‚Äì30   | Fall     | Decline      | Famine rumors, migration |
| Days 31‚Äì40   | Winter   | Conflict     | War or harsh cold        |
| Days 41‚Äì50   | New Dawn | Recovery     | Reconstruction           |
| Days 51‚Äì62   | Twilight | Closure      | End-of-year festival     |

Each phase triggers environmental + narrative shifts.

---

### 2. **NPC lifecycle templates**

Don‚Äôt make every NPC unique in time behavior. Instead:

* Define *archetypes* (worker, elder, merchant, guard, etc.).
* Assign each an event pattern and sleeping schedule.
* Script a few *key NPCs* deeply (mayor, rival, love interest).
  That way, background NPCs simulate change without unique storylines.

---

### 3. **Story modularity**

Each region can have:

* **Base story:** static narrative that works anytime.
* **Dynamic overlay:** side events that change with seasons/time (harvest fair, illness, flood, etc.).
  This ensures you don‚Äôt need to rewrite every conversation ‚Äî just layer flavor and consequences.

---

### 4. **Visual shorthand for time**

To make time progression feel rich *without massive art load*:

* Palette swaps for seasons (warm ‚Üí cold tones).
* Changing portraits (aged NPC, different clothes).
* Environmental storytelling (snow on roofs, autumn leaves).

---

### 5. **Handling sleep and downtime**

If NPCs sleep 31 hours out of 62, fill that time with:

* **Ambient world systems:** deliveries, night events, dreams, shifting background music.
* **Player reflection moments:** journal updates, visions, letters.
* **Asynchronous stories:** events happening *off-screen* that you later learn about through gossip, posters, or letters ‚Äî saving dev time but keeping the illusion of change.

---

## üéÆ Games that already do this well

* **Pathologic 2** ‚Äì days pass relentlessly; the world reacts whether you act or not.
* **Persona series** ‚Äì balances day progression, social links, and event calendars.
* **The Legend of Heroes (Trails)** ‚Äì dynamic towns and evolving dialogue per chapter.
* **Stardew Valley / Harvest Moon** ‚Äì simple but effective seasonal cycles.
* **Majora‚Äôs Mask** ‚Äì 3-day cycle masterfully built around recurring NPC routines.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Summary: how to make it work for you

‚úÖ Use *abstracted time* ‚Äî not real-time, but narrative-time.
‚úÖ Build a simple *calendar + event trigger system*.
‚úÖ Focus depth on key NPCs, breadth on archetypes.
‚úÖ Use *seasonal visual swaps* to suggest big world change cheaply.
‚úÖ Make missed events retrievable through *world storytelling* (rumors, letters).
‚úÖ Treat the world as a ‚Äúliving stage‚Äù that the player can enter and exit at any act.

If you‚Äôd like, I can help you **design a small prototype system** (e.g., a 62-day calendar event manager with day/night cycles and NPC schedules) in pseudocode or spreadsheet format ‚Äî would you like me to?

### Gemini Response
This is a fantastic and classic game design challenge, often called the "living world" problem. You're right to be curious about it‚Äîit's one of those "holy grail" concepts that many designers dream of, but few successfully implement.

Let's break down your questions, starting with the general challenges and then moving to concrete solutions for your specific 62-day RPG concept.

### Part 1: The General Challenge (Why Don't We See This More?)

You've hit on the main reasons already: it's a mix of design, technical, and resource challenges. The biggest hurdle is a massive, exponential increase in complexity and cost.

**1. The "Content Treadmill" & Exponential Cost**
This is the single biggest reason. Every "meaningful change" requires new assets and new logic.
* **NPCs age:** You don't just need one character model or portrait. You need a child, a teen, an adult, and an elder version. You also need new dialogue. What was their personality as a kid? How does it change when they're a jaded adult?
* **Cities change:** You don't just build one city map. You need the "Year 1" version (small village), the "Year 5" version (walled town), and the "Year 10" version (bustling city *or* ruined shadow). This means re-doing art, pathfinding, shop inventories, and NPC locations for *each state*.
* **Combinatorial Explosion:** Now, combine these. What happens if the player *prevents* the city from being ruined? Now you need *two* "Year 10" versions. What if the player's actions got the old mayor killed? The new mayor's political control changes the city in a *different* way. Your game state just branched, and you now have to build content for *all* possibilities, or the world feels fake.

**2. Player Agency vs. The Ticking Clock (FOMO)**
This is a core *design* tension.
* **Player-Centric vs. World-Centric:** Most RPGs are "player-centric." The world *waits* for you. The big-bad-evil-guy will patiently wait on his throne for you to finish 100 side quests. A "world-centric" game moves on *without* you.
* **The Stress of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out):** If a player hears about an amazing quest, but they are on the other side of the map and the quest expires in 3 days, it can feel *stressful* and *punishing*. Players hate feeling like they've been "locked out" of content. Games like *Majora's Mask* (with its 3-day loop) are brilliant but also highly divisive for this exact reason.
* **"My Choices Don't Matter":** The flip side is also true. If the world is *too* dynamic, the player can feel insignificant. "Why bother saving this village if it's just going to be destroyed by a scripted plague in Year 2 anyway?"

**3. Technical & Logic Hurdles (State Management)**
Tracking all of this is a technical nightmare. Every single NPC, quest, and location needs to constantly check the "world state."
* Is Quest Giver A alive?
* If not, is his son (NPC B) old enough to take over?
* Is the "plague" flag active in this region?
* If yes, is the "cure" flag also active?
* What season is it?
This complex web of logic is a breeding ground for game-breaking bugs.

**4. Development Priorities (The "Bang for your Buck" Problem)**
Given a 3-year development cycle, what's a better use of resources?
* **Option A:** Create a dynamic, 20-year time progression system where towns change... but the core combat is mediocre and there are only 10 quests.
* **Option B:** Create a *static* but incredibly detailed and polished world (like *Elden Ring* or *Baldur's Gate 3*) with deep mechanics and 100+ hours of high-quality, handcrafted content.

Most studios will (and should) choose Option B. It‚Äôs a safer bet and, for most players, a more satisfying experience.

---

### Part 2: Games That Do This Well

* ***Crusader Kings III***: This is the absolute gold standard for NPC life cycles. It's a strategy game, but its core loop is about people being born, aging, learning skills, getting married, having kids, and dying. The entire narrative is emergent, based on this "genealogical" progression.
* ***The Persona Series (esp. 3, 4, 5)***: This is your closest and best inspiration. It uses a strict day-by-day calendar. You have one year. Every day, you choose: Do I study? Do I build my social link with Ann? Do I go to the dungeon? You *cannot* do everything. This creates meaningful choice and forces the player to prioritize, solving the FOMO problem by making it a core mechanic.
* ***Stardew Valley / Animal Crossing***: Masterclasses in *seasonal* progression. The gameplay loop (crops, fish, foraging) changes with the season. Yearly festivals give the calendar a rhythm and a "real world" feel. NPCs have birthdays and simple, repeating schedules.
* ***Fable***: Famous (if not entirely successful) for its attempt at aging, changing player morality, and a world that *cosmetically* changed over time.
* ***Shenmue***: A classic example of a "real-time" world where every single NPC had a daily schedule. This was revolutionary but also meant the player spent a lot of time just... waiting.

### Part 3: Solutions for Your 62-Day RPG

Your concept is fantastic, and your constraints (2D, no free movement, story-focused) are a *massive advantage*. You've smartly cut out 90% of the cost (3D models, physics, pathfinding). Your game is about *state tracking* and *content*.

You've identified your main problem: "I need to create events and stories for each region for those 31 [active] hours/days."

You're thinking about it as a *content* problem (I have to write 31 unique scripts). Instead, think of it as a *systems* problem (I need to build a system that *selects* the right content).

Here are concrete, manageable ways to solve this:

**1. The *Persona* Model: Schedules, Not Unique Scripts**
Don't write 31 unique days of content for every NPC. That's impossible. Instead, create *two* types of content:
* **A) The "Default Loop" (The 90%):** Most days, an NPC is just "living life." They have a simple schedule. If the player talks to them, they pull from a pool of generic-but-relevant dialogue.
    * **Dialogue Pool Example:** `[Greeting]`, `[Comment on Weather/Season]`, `[Comment on recent *major* world event]`, `[Goodbye]`.
    * *"Hello, traveler. Chilly for Spring, isn't it? I heard the Duke's son is getting married."*
* **B) The "Story Beat" (The 10%):** On a *few specific days* (e.g., Day 5, Day 18, Day 40), this NPC has a *key event*. This is their *authored* story. They are in a special place, have unique dialogue, and might give a quest.

**Result:** The world feels alive because NPCs are always "doing something" (their default loop), but you only have to write the 5-10 *truly important* story moments for each character. The 62-day year acts as a *scaffolding* to hang these key moments on.

**2. The *Stardew* Model: Regional & Seasonal Events**
Use your seasons and regions to structure the player's time. This creates the "real world feel" you want.
* **Spring (Days 1-15):** The "Fertility Festival" is on Day 10 in Region A. A "Plague" storyline begins in Region B.
* **Summer (Days 16-31):** A "Drought" storyline is happening in Region A. A "Political Election" storyline is in Region B.

The player *cannot be in two places at once*. Their choice of *where to be* is the *real* choice. They feel the world moving without them. They'll hear a rumor that "the plague in Region B got bad" while they were dealing with the drought. This is your "alternative sense of choice" right there.

**3. The "Trait" Model: Systemic Change, Not Scripted Change**
This is for your "cities decay" or "NPCs change" ideas. Instead of writing a whole new city, just change its *state* and *traits*.
* **Initial State (Day 1):** City_A has traits: `Prosperous`, `Low_Taxes`, `Mayor_Beloved`.
* **Event (Day 30):** "Great Fire" event happens.
* **New State (Day 31):** City_A's traits are now: `Rebuilding`, `High_Taxes`, `Refugee_Crisis`, `Mayor_Unpopular`.

How does this change the game *without* new art?
* The "default dialogue" pool for all NPCs in that city changes. (e.g., `[Lament_About_Fire]`, `[Complain_About_Taxes]`).
* The items in the shop change (less food, more building supplies).
* The *one* city-center background portrait might change to a "scorched" version.
* A new "fast time event" (QTE) might appear: "Help clear rubble!"

**4. The "Sleepy NPC" Feature**
Your note: "NPCs sleep 31 hours [days?] of the 62... year"
This is a *brilliant* feature, not a bug. Don't see it as "I need to fill 31 days." See it as:
* **It makes NPCs feel real:** They aren't vending machines. The King is busy. The merchant is on a pilgrimage. The spy is in hiding. The player *must wait* until their "active" day.
* **It creates anticipation:** "I have to talk to the General, but he's on campaign for 10 more days. What do I do until then?" The player must go engage with a *different* story.
* **It solves your content problem:** You don't *need* content for those 31 "sleeping" days. The *absence* of the NPC *is* the content. The player's choice is what to do with that "empty" time.

By focusing on systems (schedules, traits, regional events) instead of just brute-force writing (a unique script for every day), you can absolutely achieve your goal. Your focused, 2D, story-driven approach is the *perfect* way to finally crack this design challenge.

### DeepSeek Response
Of course! This is a fascinating and ambitious design challenge. The concept of a tightly-paced, 62-day year as the core rhythm of an RPG is brilliant. Let's break down the challenges and opportunities based on your specific context.

First, to address your broad questions:

*   **What makes it hard?** For most games, it's a combination of **exponential asset creation, narrative complexity, and player anxiety.** Your design, however, cleverly sidesteps some of the biggest technical hurdles.
*   **Which genres benefit most?** RPGs (like yours), Life Sims (e.g., *The Sims*), Strategy Games (e.g., *Crusader Kings*), and Farming Sims (e.g., *Stardew Valley*) are the prime candidates.
*   **Why don't more games do it?** It's primarily a **dev priority and design scope** issue. It's a massive undertaking that doesn't fit the "infinite playtime" model of many open-world games.
*   **Games that do it well:**
    *   **The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask:** The quintessential example of a tight, 3-day cycle. Everyone's schedule is meticulously planned.
    *   **Stardew Valley:** Seasons change crop availability, foraging, and festivals. The world is on a predictable, repeating annual clock.
    *   **Crusader Kings III:** A grand strategy where characters age, die, have children, and dynasties rise and fall over centuries.
    *   **The Sims:** The most direct example of characters aging and lives progressing.
    *   **Fable II/III:** Features a "long-term" world change where your choices visibly alter cities and the landscape over years.

Now, let's dive into the specific challenges and solutions for **your 62-day year concept.**

---

### The Core Challenges in Your Design & How to Solve Them

Your game's 2D, dialogue-and-portrait-focused nature is its greatest strength here. It removes the nightmare of 3D world transformation and complex AI pathfinding. The challenges become primarily **narrative and systemic design** problems.

#### 1. The "Sleeping NPC" Problem & Event Density
You've identified the core issue: NPCs are "off-stage" for half the game year (31 hours). This can make the world feel empty if not handled correctly.

**Solutions:**

*   **Embrace the "Night Shift":** Not everyone sleeps at the same time. Create a **nocturnal ecosystem**.
    *   **Factions:** Thieves' guilds, night watch, innkeepers, bards, and illicit lovers are all active at night.
    *   **Regional Night Themes:** Assign a primary "night activity" to each region. The merchant district has a night market. The docks have smugglers arriving. The noble district has lavish parties. The slums have a different, more dangerous set of encounters. This means you're not creating 31 unique hours, but 5-8 "types" of night hours that rotate.
*   **The "Player-Centric" Night:** The night is for the player's personal progression.
    *   **Crafting & Research:** Use this time for potion-making, studying lore, deciphering clues, or training skills in a safe space.
    *   **Dream Sequences & Visions:** These are perfect for delivering backstory, prophecies, or character development without needing the NPCs to be physically present. They are cheap to create (new portrait, text box, background).
    *   **Planing & Preparation:** The player can review their goals, manage inventory, and decide on their strategy for the next "active" day cycle.

#### 2. Narrative Branching & The "Butterfly Effect"
With a fixed, short timeline, every player action can have cascading consequences. Tracking this can become a nightmare.

**Solutions:**

*   **Use a "Story State" System, Not an "NPC State" System:** Instead of tracking every individual NPC's relationship with everyone else, track the overall state of key **story threads** and **regions**.
    *   **Flags:** Use simple boolean flags (True/False) and counters. `Flag: "Convinced_Blacksmith_To_Join_Rebellion"`, `Counter: "Rebellion_Support = +5"`.
    *   **Regional Status:** Each region has a status like `Prosperous`, `Struggling`, `Rebellious`, `Occupied`. Events and player choices move the needle between these states. This is far more manageable than simulating every citizen.
*   **The "Illusion of Depth":** You don't need to create a unique outcome for every possible combination of events. Create outcomes for the **most likely paths**. Use generic, but thematic, reactions for others.
    *   *Example:* If the player misses an event to help a farmer, they don't need a unique line of dialogue from the blacksmith. Instead, the next time the player enters the village, the "Regional Status" shifts slightly, and a generic village NPC portrait says, "A shame about Old Man Hemmel's crop. We'll be feeling that this winter." The *world* reacts, not every individual.

#### 3. Player Anxiety & Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)
A relentless, real-time clock can be stressful. Players might feel they can't explore or make mistakes without ruining their chances.

**Solutions:**

*   **Clarity and Predictability:** Give players a **Calendar**. Let them see upcoming known events (Harvest Festival, Royal Wedding, Eclipse). This turns pressure from anxiety into strategic planning.
*   **Parallel, Not Serial, Storylines:** Design your major quests to run in parallel, not series. The "Rebellion Plot" and the "Ancient Curse Plot" should both be active throughout the 62 days. The player cannot complete everything in one playthrough. This is a **design feature, not a bug.** It directly enables your goal of "allowing the player to engage with a specific story at any point in its stages" and massively boosts replayability.
*   **Embrace the "Failed" Playthrough:** Frame the game not as a puzzle to be "solved," but as a story to be "experienced." A playthrough where the player fails to stop the villain is a valid, tragic story. The next playthrough, they know what's coming and can act faster.

### A Practical Implementation Framework for Your Game

Here is a potential structure for your 62-day year:

1.  **The Year is Divided into "Chapters" (Seasons):**
    *   **Spring (Days 1-15):** Setup. Introduce major factions and primary conflicts. The world is "open" for exploration.
    *   **Summer (Days 16-31):** Escalation. Conflicts deepen. The consequences of Spring choices become apparent.
    *   **Autumn (Days 32-47):** Convergence. Storylines collide. The player must make hard choices about which crises to prioritize.
    *   **Winter (Days 48-62):** Resolution. The final acts of the major storylines play out, leading to the year's end state.

2.  **The "Regional Event Deck":**
    *   For each region, you create a deck of events. These are not fixed to a specific day, but to a **condition**.
    *   *Example Event Card:*
        *   **Title:** Smuggler's Cove Exposed
        *   **Trigger Condition:** `Regional_Status(Docks) == "Corrupt" AND Player_Reputation(Guards) < 30`
        *   **Time of Day:** Night
        *   **Outcomes:**
            *   `Success:` Unlocks black market merchant. `Regional_Status(Docks) becomes "Lawless"`.
            *   `Failure:` Player loses gold. `Regional_Status(Docks) becomes "Patrolled"`.

    This system creates dynamic, responsive storytelling without requiring a rigid, day-by-day script for the entire world.

### Conclusion: Your Game's Unique Advantage

Your concept is not hindered by the typical technical limitations. Your challenges are narrative and structural. By leaning into your strengths‚Äî**2D art, dialogue, and portraits**‚Äîyou can create a deeply reactive world.

**Your key takeaways should be:**

*   **Structure the Night:** Make it a purposeful part of the game loop with its own themes and activities.
*   **Track Stories, Not People:** Use a "Regional Status" and "Story Flag" system to manage complexity.
*   **Design for Replayability:** Make parallel, mutually exclusive storylines a core feature.
*   **Manage Player Anxiety:** Give players a calendar and frame failure as a valid narrative outcome.

This is a fantastic and viable design. The constraints you've chosen (2D, 62-day year) are what will make it possible and unique. Good luck! This is exactly the kind of innovative thinking the RPG genre needs.
