## Question 039

Question's subreddit link: https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1npbhra/what_do_you_think_about_a_system_that_rewards

Date: 2025-09-24

## Problem Description
What do you think about a system that rewards exploration in a... more tangible way? ‚Äî Context: I'm working as a game designer on a small team while we develop a Souls-like

The trick is that I came up with this system. The player can explore the entire map and while doing so, he has a tool that allows him to put icons, notes and draw routes on the map. On top of this, the more you interact with the world, little moments of emergent narrative occur where you have the option to weaken the boss organically and diegetically. Is it a good concept? What other things could enrich it? What weaknesses could it have? I will be attentive to any comments.

Edit: The criticism from everyone who has participated so far is appreciated, I wanted to make it clear that I misused the word "weaken" it is not that the boss does less damage or you do more damage, it is actually a qualitative change immersed in the narrative, power is information, knowing how it will attack before it does, a new weak point that you can take advantage of or a conditional that opens the way to an opening that the player can take advantage of.

## Best Human-rated Answer
I absolutely love when games have rich exploration elements. I think having lore being unveiled for the player as a reward for exploration is a great idea.

On the other hand, I'm not a fan of having the boss weakened by the act of exploring. To me it cheapens the experience. People who explore a lot of your world will be playing for a long time, which means they'll become good at the game and can probably take on a challenge. Making the boss weaker is probably going to be less fun for them. They can either have an exciting fight with no exploration or a boring, easy fight with a lot of exploration. Personally I'd like to have both : challenge and exploration.

The people who will want an easy fight with the boss are usually those who don't have a lot of time to play and therefore won't be as good at the game. Those won't have time for exploration either. Hence an easy difficulty should probably come in the form a setting option if you want to cather to that demographic.

If you want exploration to affect the boss, you could gp in the direction of increasing its loot the more a player explore the world around. Or even making his dialogue and/or moves change depending on what was explored. Basically anything that make the fight more interesting and not less.

### ChatGPT-5 Response
That‚Äôs a really interesting and promising system ‚Äî it has a lot of potential for meaningful, *diegetic* exploration, something that Souls-likes often flirt with but rarely make fully systemic. Let‚Äôs unpack it in terms of **strengths**, **weaknesses**, and **ways to enrich it**.

---

### üåü Strengths of the Concept

1. **Exploration as Mechanical Power**
   Making exploration directly affect boss encounters (through knowledge or preparation) gives tangible payoff to curiosity ‚Äî not just loot. It‚Äôs *very Souls-like* in spirit but offers a deeper layer of systemic storytelling.

2. **Player-Authored Discovery**
   The map-marking tool encourages player expression ‚Äî a sense of ownership over their journey. Players *remember* things they map themselves, which deepens immersion and engagement.

3. **Diegetic Integration**
   Having the exploration rewards expressed through narrative or environmental discovery rather than arbitrary bonuses (‚Äú+10% damage‚Äù) fits perfectly with Souls-like design ethos: the world itself *teaches* you how to win.

4. **Organic Learning Loop**
   Encouraging players to learn enemy behaviors, lore, and weaknesses through exploration could elegantly tie gameplay mastery and narrative understanding together.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Weaknesses / Design Challenges

1. **Communicating Payoff Without Breaking Mystery**
   Players might not realize their exploration had an effect if it‚Äôs too subtle ‚Äî but making it *too explicit* risks breaking immersion. You‚Äôll need a careful feedback system (audio-visual, or narrative) to show that their discoveries mattered.

2. **Balancing Reward vs. Frustration**
   If some bosses are *significantly easier* after full exploration, completionist players may feel forced to do all exploratory steps before each major fight, turning the system into a checklist rather than a discovery.

3. **Narrative Coherence**
   ‚ÄúEmergent narrative moments‚Äù need to feel consistent and not arbitrary. You‚Äôll want to define rules for when and how they appear ‚Äî otherwise it can feel random or scripted.

4. **Pacing Risk**
   Slower, deliberate exploration may clash with the tension of a Souls-like if not paced properly. Too much pre-boss wandering could dilute the intensity or frustrate players who prefer tighter combat loops.

---

### üí° Ways to Enrich the System

1. **Layered Discovery Tiers**

   * First interaction: small hints (scribbles, corpses, environmental storytelling).
   * Second interaction: actual tactical insight (e.g. the boss‚Äôs weapon being forged here reveals its weak material).
   * Final interaction: a choice or event that *changes* the fight (e.g. freeing a captive that the boss relies on).

2. **Player Agency in What to Pursue**

   * Let the player decide *which* types of exploration matter: lore, environment, character connections.
   * Maybe players who explore certain paths unlock *different kinds* of boss insights (behavioral vs. environmental).

3. **Persistent Player Notes as World Objects**

   * Imagine another player finding your ‚Äúmark‚Äù or ‚Äúnote‚Äù (if multiplayer or asynchronous). Even in single-player, your notes could visually ‚Äúage‚Äù or have in-world effects ‚Äî bridging meta and diegesis.

4. **Dynamic Boss Reactions**

   * If the player *knows* too much, the boss could *adapt* in subtle ways ‚Äî recognizing the player‚Äôs preparedness and shifting tactics. Keeps replayability and tension alive.

5. **Environmental Synergy**

   * Exploration could also reveal shortcuts, traps, or usable elements *within* the boss arena itself ‚Äî reinforcing the feeling that knowledge = power.

6. **Narrative Payoff**

   * Tie discoveries into the lore ‚Äî maybe the ‚Äúweakness‚Äù is moral or historical. The boss might have been a protector once; understanding that changes how you fight them.

---

### üß≠ Summary

Your system has a ton of promise: it gives exploration *narrative and mechanical weight*, aligns perfectly with Souls-like design philosophy, and could make the world feel truly *interconnected*.
The main risks are clarity and pacing ‚Äî if players don‚Äôt *feel* the payoff or find it tedious to trigger, the system may underdeliver. The key is **communicating discovery as part of the emotional rhythm** of exploration, not as a checklist.

---

Would you like me to sketch a **concrete example** (e.g., one boss and how exploration changes the encounter)? That might help visualize how to tune the mechanics and narrative feedback loop.

### Gemini Response
This is an excellent concept, especially with the clarification you provided.

In fact, you've hit on one of the most satisfying potential loops in game design: using *information* as a tangible reward. It perfectly complements the Souls-like genre, which is already built on player observation and learning.

Let's break down your questions.

### 1. Is it a good concept?

**Yes, it's a *fantastic* concept.** Here‚Äôs why it works so well for a Souls-like:

* **Preserves Player Agency:** The core "Souls" contract is that victory is *earned* through skill. Your system doesn't break this. Giving the player a 10% damage buff is a cheap, external reward. Giving them the *knowledge* that "the beast's pincer attack is preceded by a high-pitched shriek" is an *internal* reward that still requires skill to execute. The player feels smart *and* skillful.
* **Diegetically Rewards Exploration:** It provides a *purpose* for exploration beyond finding another Titanite Shard. The player isn't just clearing a map; they are an archaeologist, a detective, a cartographer. The exploration loop (find clues) directly feeds the combat loop (exploit clues).
* **Deepens Environmental Storytelling:** A Souls-like tells its story through the world. Your system makes this explicit. The player *must* engage with the environmental storytelling (find the ritual site, read the madman's note, see the giant's corpse) to gain a mechanical advantage.
* **The Map Tool is the Perfect Anchor:** A map tool that the player actively curates (notes, drawings) makes them *process* the information. They aren't just getting a quest log update ("Objective: Find weak point"). They are finding a clue‚Äî"The hermit's journal mentions the creature 'hates the sound of the sanctuary bell'"‚Äîand then *they* have to put an icon on their map for the bell and the boss, making the connection themselves.

### 2. What other things could enrich it?

You can expand this "information is power" concept in several ways.

#### A. Specific Types of "Weakening" (Qualitative Changes)

* **Environmental Triggers:** The player explores an area *above* the boss arena and finds a note about "unstable supports." They draw this on their map. During the fight, they can bait the boss into charging that spot, or perhaps find a way to shoot it, to trigger a rockfall that stuns the boss and creates a massive opening.
* **Ritual/Source of Power:** Exploration reveals the boss is drawing power from three "ethereal tethers" linked to hidden statues in the world. Finding and destroying these statues *before* the fight doesn't lower the boss's stats, but it *removes one of its attacks* (e.g., its most dangerous magical AOE spell simply fails to cast).
* **Pre-emptive Knowledge (Tells):** This is your "knowing how it will attack" idea.
    * **Visual:** Finding a "scryer's lens" or reading a prophetic text might cause the player to see a faint, 1-second "afterimage" or a specific color-flash right before the boss uses its unblockable grab attack.
    * **Audio:** A note describes how a beast "always howls at the moon before it lunges." In the fight, that specific attack is now telegraphed by a unique audio cue the player learned to listen for.
* **Creating New Weak Points:** Perhaps the player finds a "corrupted heart" of a previous warrior who fought the boss. The text reveals this warrior "coated his blade in Moon-Oil." The player can then find this (rare) oil. Using it doesn't add damage; it makes it so their attacks can *break* the boss's ethereal armor, creating a *new* physical weak point that wasn't there before.
* **Conditional Openings:** Exploration reveals the boss is "blind in its left eye" or "overcompensates for an old leg wound." This could mean that *only* dodging to its left side (the blind side) during a *specific* attack will grant a longer punish window.

#### B. Integrating the Map Tool More Deeply

* **"Connecting the Dots":** Don't just let them put icons. What if they find three "rune fragments" in the world? They have to place all three on their map, and only when they *draw a triangle* connecting them does the game register the "ah-ha!" moment, updating their journal with the boss's secret.
* **Cartographer's Log:** The map tool could have a dedicated "Lore" or "Clues" section. When the player finds a key piece of info, it's *not* interpreted for them. It's just copied into their log.
    * *Clue 1:* "Found a burnt note: ...the beast recoils from bright light..."
    * *Clue 2:* "Found a guard's diary: ...used the last of our 'Sun-Flash' bombs..."
    * The player has to *read their own notes* and realize, "I should try using a Sun-Flash bomb on the boss!"
* **Revealing Paths:** The player might find a "ghostly echo" of a fight. This prompts their map tool to "remember" a potential route. They can then draw this route on their 3D map, which reveals a hidden vantage point *in the boss arena* (e.g., a ledge they can jump to) that they wouldn't have otherwise seen.

### 3. What weaknesses could it have?

This is a robust concept, but it's *vital* to be aware of the potential pitfalls.

* **The "Checklist" Problem (Pacing):**
    * **Weakness:** If the boss is *too* difficult without these clues, exploration stops being a "reward" and becomes a *mandatory chore*. Players will feel like they're just grinding a checklist ("Ugh, gotta find the 3 'weaken' points") before they're "allowed" to have fun.
    * **Solution:** The boss must be *beatable* (though extremely difficult) from the start. These "weakenings" should feel like *optional, smart-player advantages*, not *requirements*. This rewards the most dedicated explorers while not stonewalling players who just want the "pure" fight.
* **The "Obscurity" Problem (Signposting):**
    * **Weakness:** It's a classic Souls problem. If the clues are *too* cryptic (e.g., "The 5th raven on the 3rd tree...") players will either miss them entirely or just go straight to a wiki. This defeats the *entire* purpose of your system, as it's no longer rewarding *their* exploration, but their ability to use Google.
    * **Solution:** *Signposting is critical.* The clues don't have to be easy, but they must be *findable* and *logical*. Your map tool is the key. When a player finds a clue, *log it*. The puzzle shouldn't be "Did I miss a random item in a dark corner?" The puzzle should be "I have these three clues in my map log, what do they mean *together*?"
* **The "Lack of Feedback" Problem (Clarity):**
    * **Weakness:** The player does all the work, finds the clue... and then nothing feels different in the boss fight. They don't understand *what* changed. "The game said I found a weakness, but I'm still getting killed. This system is useless."
    * **Solution:** *Feedback must be 100% clear.*
        * If an environmental trigger is created, it must be *visually obvious* (e.g., the ceiling cracks and glows).
        * If a new weak point is opened, it must *visibly shatter* and cause a large boss stagger when hit.
        * If a pre-attack tell is added, it must be unmistakable (the *only* time that *specific* audio shriek plays).
* **The "Trivialization" Problem (Balance):**
    * **Weakness:** You find all the clues, and the boss becomes a complete pushover. This robs the player of the satisfaction of mastering a Souls-like boss.
    * **Solution:** Stick to your "information is power" rule. The "weakenings" should *create opportunities for skill*, not *remove the need for skill*. A longer stagger window is great. An "auto-dodge" button is not.

**Final Verdict:** This is a top-tier design concept. It leans into the best parts of its genre and solves the common problem of exploration feeling disconnected from the core challenge. Your main development challenge will be *balance* and *clarity*‚Äîmaking the clues discoverable without being obvious, and the rewards impactful without being game-breaking. Good luck.

### DeepSeek Response
Of course! This is a fantastic and highly promising concept. It takes the core Souls-like loop of overcoming immense challenge through knowledge and mastery and externalizes it into a tangible, player-driven system. Let's break down its strengths, potential weaknesses, and ways to enrich it.

### Is it a good concept?

**Yes, absolutely.** This is more than just a good concept; it's a potential genre-evolver. Here‚Äôs why it's so strong:

1.  **Makes Exploration Meaningful:** In many games, exploration rewards you with a consumable or a stat boost. Your system rewards the player with **Power Through Knowledge**. This is perfectly aligned with the Souls-like philosophy but makes the process more active and player-driven.
2.  **Diegetic and Immersive:** The player isn't just opening a menu to see a boss's weakness; they are using their own tools, notes, and observations to deduce it. This deepens the connection to the world and makes the player feel like a true explorer and hunter.
3.  **Encourages Player Agency:** The player isn't just following quest markers. They are creating their own objectives, marking their own paths, and formulating their own strategies. This creates a powerful sense of ownership over their journey.
4.  **"Emergent Narrative" is Key:** The "little moments" you describe are the heart of the system. They transform the world from a static backdrop into a dynamic, reactive space with its own stories. Finding a discarded diary, witnessing a specific event, or noticing an environmental clue *that you can then mark on your map* is incredibly engaging.

### Potential Weaknesses & How to Mitigate Them

Even the best ideas have pitfalls. Being aware of them is crucial.

1.  **Weakness: The "Checklist" Mentality.**
    *   **Risk:** Players might feel they need to find *every single* narrative trigger to stand a chance, turning exploration into a tedious chore rather than an organic adventure.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Over-tune, Don't Under-tune:** Design the bosses to be beatable without any of these discoveries, but significantly easier/more manageable with them. The discoveries should feel like "aha!" moments that provide a clever edge, not mandatory keys.
        *   **Multiple Paths to Victory:** Offer several different narrative triggers that can weaken the same boss in different ways. A player might discover one or two, but not all. This preserves the feeling of a personal journey.

2.  **Weakness: Cluttering and UI Confusion.**
    *   **Risk:** A player's map could become an indecipherable mess of icons and scribbles, especially if the drawing tools are too free-form.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Structured Freedom:** Offer a set of clear, distinct icons (Skull for danger, Question Mark for mystery, Eye for "observe here," etc.) rather than just a free-draw paintbrush.
        *   **Layering System:** Allow players to toggle their notes on and off, or even have separate "layers" (e.g., a "Boss Clues" layer, a "Resources" layer, a "Secret Paths" layer).

3.  **Weakness: The "Guide Dang It!" Problem.**
    *   **Risk:** If the narrative triggers are too obscure, players will immediately go to online guides, bypassing your carefully designed system entirely.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Clear Cause and Effect:** The link between the discovery and the boss's change must be logical. If you find a soldier's note describing the boss's fear of fire, the boss should visibly recoil when you use a torch. This reinforces the system's internal logic and teaches the player to trust their own observations.
        *   **Environmental Storytelling:** Place clues in the environment leading to the trigger. For example, a trail of unique scorch marks might lead to a hidden NPC who gives you a fire-based item.

4.  **Weakness: Balancing the "Qualitative" Change.**
    *   **Risk:** A "qualitative change" is harder to design than a simple stat reduction. A new weak point is great, but if it's *too* powerful, it can trivialize the fight.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Make it a Phase Shift:** The discovery could trigger a new, more manageable phase in the boss fight. For example, discovering a structural weakness causes the boss to collapse partway through, changing the arena and limiting its mobility for the rest of the fight.
        *   **Create an Opening, Not a Win Button:** The "conditional that opens a way to an opening" is perfect. This rewards player skill‚Äîthey still have to recognize the opening and execute the dodge/attack‚Äîwhile giving them a much larger window for success.

---

### How to Enrich the System

Here are some concrete ideas to build upon your excellent foundation:

1.  **Multi-layered Clues:** Don't make it a single "eureka" moment. A clue could be a three-part process:
    *   **Part 1 (The Rumor):** You find a fragment of a scroll in a ruined library mentioning the "Golem's Crystal Heart."
    *   **Part 2 (The Observation):** You use your map tool to mark this. Later, while fighting the boss, you notice a faint glow on its chest, but it's always armored. You can add an observation note to your existing marker.
    *   **Part 3 (The Solution):** Exploring a mine below the boss arena, you find unstable resonance crystals. You realize you can shoot them to cause a cave-in that damages the Golem's chest armor, exposing the weak point for the fight.

2.  **Player-Generated "Wisdom":** This is a Souls-like staple. Allow players to leave behind *ghostly, pre-recorded markers or notes* for other players (or their own future characters in a New Game+). Seeing that another player has marked a wall with an "Illusion ahead" message or a boss door with "Try fire" creates a powerful sense of shared discovery.

3.  **Tools with Multiple Functions:** Your mapping tool shouldn't just be for notes.
    *   **Echo-location:** A sonar-like pulse that reveals hidden paths or invisible enemies on the map, but has a cooldown or limited uses.
    *   **Environmental Analysis:** The ability to "scan" certain environmental objects to get more lore or a clue about a nearby secret.

4.  **Tie it to a "Lore Detective" Skill Tree:** As players explore and succeed, they can invest in skills that enhance their mapping tool: unlocking new icon types, allowing them to see the "ghostly footsteps" of a creature they're tracking, or even getting a subtle audio/visual cue when they are near a major narrative trigger.

### Final Summary

Your concept is brilliant because it directly rewards the most engaging part of a Souls-like: the player's intellect and curiosity. It turns the world itself into a puzzle and the boss fights into the climax of a mystery the player has solved themselves.

**Your core philosophy is correct: "Power is Information."** Lean into that. Focus on making the information logical, rewarding to find, and impactful in a way that feels clever rather than simply making numbers go up. If executed well, this system could be the defining feature that sets your game apart in a crowded genre.

Good luck to you and your team! This is exactly the kind of innovative thinking the genre needs.
